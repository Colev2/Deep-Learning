Assignment on Deep-Learning course at ECE AUTH

# Deep Learning Assignment – ECE AUTH

This repository contains my assignment for the **Deep Learning** course at the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)**.

The goal of the assignment is to study and compare different deep learning architectures and training strategies on a small medical imaging dataset.

## Contents

The assignment consists of **three main parts**:

1. **CNN**  
   - Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network and experimenting with different techniques
 
2. **Transfer Learning with CNN**  
   - Transfer learning using a pretrained **ResNet18** model  
   - Comparison between feature extraction and fine-tuning  

3. **Transfer Learning with Vision Transformer**  
   - Transfer learning using a pretrained **DeiT**  Transformer
   - Compoarison between feature extraction and fine-tuning 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **BloodMNIST**, from the **MedMNIST** collection.  

## Framework

- **PyTorch**
- **timm** (for pretrained Vision Transformer models)
